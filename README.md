### 0.0 Introduction
___

**Computer Science** is the discipline that seeks to build a scientific foundation for such topics as computer design, programming, info processing, algorithmic solutions, and the process itself. It provides a backbone for today's computer applications as well as for tomorrow's infrastructure.

### 0.1 The Role of Algorithms
___

+ An algorithm is simply a set of steps that define how a task should be completed. For example a cooking recipe is an algorithm technically.

Before a machine can perform a task, an algorithm for handling said task must be utilized in a language the computer can understand. **Programming/Coding** is the act of developing a program and encoding it in the language a computer can understand. Programs and the algorithms they represent are referred to as software.

The study of algorithms began as a subject of mathematics, which held benefits long before computers were invented. The goal was to find a single set of directions that described how all problems of a specific type can be solved.

**Once an algorithm for performing a task has been found, the performance of the task no longer requires an understanding of the foundations of said algorithm.** Using algorithms as a means of conveying intelligence to machines has become useful in allowing them to perform useful tasks. By that metric, ** the level of intelligence of a machine is limited to the capabilities of the algorithm deployed.
